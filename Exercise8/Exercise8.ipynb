    "As classifier we chose support vector machine, since it is a robust classifier that deals well with the noise and avoids overfitting using a soft margin. Here we have that the classes overlap with each other in most cases, so it is good to use a soft margin approach (we selected a low value of the 'C' parameter of SVC) to let a margin of error in the classification and avoid overfitting. Also the kernel function is linear, since with a non-linear function it may overfit to the training data. In short, the SVM is appropiate in this case to avoid overfitting and deal with the noise. \n",
